            <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
        <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
            
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
            
            C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
            
            C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>

            <h3>Features of C++</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many options that come to mind when we think of choosing a programming language. </li>
                <li>C++ is one of the most famous programming languages available to us.</li>
                <li>Also, check the comparison between the two most popular languages, C++ or Java. Each programming language has their own benefits and perk</li>
                <li>There are different and valuable features of the C++ programming language that we will cover here.

                </li>
                
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic syntax</h3>
            <pre style="background-color: whitesmoke;">
                <code>
                    #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

                int main() 
                { 
                
                    
                    auto an_int = 26;

                    cout << typeid(a_bool).name() << "\n"; 
                    cout << typeid(an_int).name() << "\n";

            <h3>Application of C++</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>C++ is frequently used to create system-level software, such as device drivers, firmware, and operating systems</li>
                <li>Many video games are created using this language due to C++'s efficiency and low-level hardware access capabilities. C++ is widely used in well-known gaming engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.</li>
                <li>A large range of desktop apps, such as programs for graphic editing, office suites, and 3D modeling, can be made using C++.</li>
                <li>C++ is frequently used in embedded systems programming for hardware like microcontrollers a</li>
                <li>C++ is frequently used in applications demanding high-performance computation, such as scientific simulations, numerical analysis, and financial modeling, due to its effectiveness and optimization capabilities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
        <h3>What is an array </h3>
        <p>An array is a visual representation of numbers, objects, or pictures in rows and columns. Arrays can be used to demonstrate multiplication and division concepts. For example, an array with 3 columns and 2 rows</p>

        <h3>Charactertics of an Array</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>An array is always stored in consecutive memory location.
                The particular element of an a</li>
            <li> It can store multiple value of similar type, which can be referred with single name.</li>
            <li>
                The pointer points to the first location of memory block, which is allocated to the array name.</li>
                <li> An array can either be an integer, character, or float data type that can be initialised only during the declaration.</li>
                
         </ul>

         <h3>Types of an Array</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Fixed Size Array
                <ol>
                    <li>You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>  Dynamic Sized Array
                <ol>
                    <li>data_type: is a type of data of each array block.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Dimensional Array
                <ul>
                    <li>A 3-D Multidimensional array contains three dimensions, so it can be considered an array of two-dimensional arrays.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multi-Dimensional Array
                <ul>
                    <li>sizeof_dimension: is the number of blocks of memory array going to have in the corresponding dimension.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
